	 *  BENEFITS OF JAVA: 
	 *  I. Object Oriented
	 *  	All code is defined in classes, most of which are instantiated as objects.
	 *  
	 *  II. Robust
	 *  	Memory leaks are mitigated. Garbage Collection is automatic and memory is managed on its own.
	 *  
	 *  III. Secure
	 *  	Java code runs in the JVM, and it is harder for Java code to break your computer.
	 *  
	 *  IV. Encapsulation
	 *  	Protects classes from unintended access and modification.
	 *  
	 *  V. Simple
	 *  	No operator overloading, and the resulting confusion it can bring.
	 *  
	 *  VI. Platform Independent.
	 * 		"Write once, run everywhere."
